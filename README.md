# Number Guessing Game
 My first TechDegree project from Team Treehouse

In this project, I created a game in Python where user enters a number between 1 and 100 to guess the number that was randomly picked.
First, the game will pick a random number between 1 and 100.
Then the user will be prompted to enter a number. Once the number has been entered, the user will be told if the guess is lower than or
higher than the number picked randomly. The user will keep guessing until they guess the number correctly.

Once the user has correctly guessed the number, the user will be shown how many guesses it took before they guessed the correct number. 
The number of guesses for each game are stored in a list with the lowest guess count being shown to the user before each game starts,
as long as a game was previously played.
